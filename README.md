## Repo Structure
Code: includes the source code to caculate HLRC and HFRC, while the computation of HORC in julia should refers to the implementation given in https://github.com/aidos-lab/orchid.git.
  - special_hypg, hsbm: special uniform hypergraphs were visualized, and synthetic hypergraphs based on stochastic block model were generated and evaluated.
  - contact-high school, MADStat, MAG-10, Mus, Stex: the real-world dataset evaluation
      1. Data process
      2. Curvature computation
      3. Visualization/Comparions
  - runtime: generated synthetic Chungâ€“Lu hypergraphs as the number of hyperedges, the number of nodes, and the average hyperedge size varied one at a time.

Data: all raw data.
